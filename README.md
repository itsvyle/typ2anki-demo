# Typst to Anki demo

This is my personal configuration for writing Anki cards in Typst, alongside with examples of cards - the cards are compiled with a width of 330pt, as I want to be able to use them on my phone

I will NOT accept any issues or PRs, as this is merely a demonstration of how I use typ2anki at the given moment - I will NOT maintain this repository to keep it up to date with the latest changes in typ2anki.
